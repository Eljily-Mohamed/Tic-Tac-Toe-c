# Tic Tac Toe Game - C Implementation

## Overview

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe project! This project involves the development of a Tic Tac Toe game where a player can compete against a computer on a PC. The game is implemented in C, and the AI for the computer opponent is powered by the Minimax algorithm, which is integrated into an STM32 microcontroller. The communication between the PC and the STM32 board is established via a serial connection.

## Features

- Tic Tac Toe game playable on a PC.
- AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm.
- Communication with STM32 microcontroller via serial interface.
- Optimized for an engaging player vs. computer experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- A PC running any operating system with a C compiler installed.
- An STM32 microcontroller board.
- A serial communication interface (e.g., USB to UART adapter).
